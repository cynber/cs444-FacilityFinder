# Project Update 3

This blog post will include a revision to the task examples, information about our low-fidelity prototype and cognitive walkthrough, and more thoughts on the overall goals of our experiment.

## 3a. Further Updated Task Examples

!!! quote "Original Task Examples"

    Task Example 1: Jeffrey
    
    Jeffrey is a biomedical engineering and experimental medicine graduate student at UBC. Jeffrey’s partner works on campus as well and he considers himself to be well familiar with general campus amenities. On days when they are both busy, they utilise UBC’s daycare service for their child. Jeffrey, his partner, and their child (Geoff) will often meet on campus after work/class before deciding on dinner plans. Geoff – being 13 months old, requires regular diaper changes. He prefers to do so in male bathrooms that have a changing table as he doesn’t like occupying the accessible bathroom unless absolutely necessary.  
    
    Jeffrey knows of 2 bathrooms on campus that have changing tables. One in his department’s building, and another close by to his and his partner’s usual meet spot. On occasion, his child will need a diaper change while he is exploring a new area of campus. During these times, Jeffrey typically opts for returning to 1 of his 2 safe bathroom spots as he is unfamiliar with which surrounding buildings have (ideally male) bathrooms with change tables, which buildings have restricted access, and where specifically the bathrooms are located within each building, etc.
    
    
    Task Example 2: Karen
    
    Karen is a parent taking photos of her son by the UBC fountain before his graduation ceremony. This is her first time on campus, so she is unfamiliar with the facilities. The ceremony is starting soon, so she wants to find a washroom nearby that she can access quickly without much walking since she is wearing uncomfortable shoes. Since it is a later in the day, she is not sure which buildings are open to the public and which ones need keycard access, such as those that are locked after a certain time. It would take some time to check each building for access and facilities, and she is not sure which one will be easiest to access for her. She can ask her son for directions, and he is able to direct her towards a building, but she does not know where to go after entering the building and needs a way to find further directions.   
    
    
    Task Example 3: Marie
    
    Marie is a new teaching staff member at UBC and requires a wheelchair to move across campus. She has not had an orientation of the buildings she is teaching in and is not familiar with where facilities are located. Marie has a very busy schedule, with lecture blocks right after each other. She needs to find a washroom between her classes that is wheelchair accessible. She also wants to find a washroom that is close to her next class but worries about washroom availability with many students also using this time to use the restroom.

### Revised Task Examples

Two of our task examples remain unchanged, but the second task example called "Karen" has been updated slightly.

    **Revised Task Example 2: Karen**

    Karen is a parent taking photos of her son at the UBC fountain prior to his wedding ceremony. This is her first time on campus, so she is unfamiliar with the facilities. As this is a private event, there are no UBC staff members that can assist. The ceremony is starting soon, so she wants to find a washroom nearby that she can access quickly without much walking since she is wearing uncomfortable shoes. Since it is a later in the day, she is not sure which buildings are open to the public and which ones need keycard access, such as those that are locked after a certain time. It would take some time to check each building for access and facilities, and she is not sure which one will be easiest to access for her. She can ask her son for directions, and he is able to direct her towards a building, but she does not know where to go after entering the building. 

We changed the context of the task example to be a wedding ceremony instead of a graduation ceremony. As graduation ceremonies typically have lots of staff and volunteers to help guide guests, we wanted to make the task example more challenging and generalized by removing this support. Also, we removed the specific details on how she completed the task to make the task example more open-ended and allow participants to come up with their own solutions. 

Other than this change, the task examples remain the same. Our task examples went through a significant update in blog update #2, and they continue to be applicable and relevant to the current direction of our designs. We currently do not have any significant updates to our requirements or methodology to justify changing the other task examples.
