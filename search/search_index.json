It will also include 3 task examples to illustrate the plan for the project.</p> <p>Original Project Proposal</p> <p>The UBC Campus Washroom Guide (BB - L2A)</p> <p>It will offer a user-friendly interface for quickly locating washrooms across the UBC campus. Key features include a real-time location-based Emergency Mode for urgent needs, detailed information on washroom availability and accessibility, and user feedback integration for continuous improvement. This app aims to enhance campus experience by ensuring convenient and timely access to washroom facilities for students, staff, alumni, and visitors.</p> <p>Project Update</p> <p>To get this project started, we have decided to focus on building access, we have limited our scope to washrooms on the UBC Vancouver campus, and we have identified a few details that a user may look for when trying to find a washroom.</p> <p>Firstly, we want to focus more on the user's ability to access the washroom in the first place. Some information that would be necessary for the user include building access (ex. public access, private keycard access), building hours, accessible entrance locations, and any ramps or elevators that may be necessary to access the washroom.</p> <p>Secondly, we wanted to clarify our scope to be washrooms on the UBC Vancouver campus. This would provide a wide variety of washrooms and building types to work with, and it would be easy to find participants to test the interface. While washrooms and building access are the focus with this first interface, future work could expand to other amenities on campus such as water fountains, showers, microwaves, etc.</p> <p>Finally, we have identified some information that a user would want to know when looking for a bathroom. As the location of men's, women's, and gender-neutral washrooms may vary, being able to filter the results would be important. Similarly, the user may want to know if a washroom is busy as this may affect factors such as privacy, cleanliness, and wait time. The user may also want to know if there are other features such as baby changing stations, menstrual product dispensers, or sharps containers.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/01/29/project-update-1/#task-examples","title":"Task Examples","text":"<p>Task Example 1: Jeffrey</p> <p>Jeffrey is a biomedical engineering and experimental medicine graduate student at UBC.

In particular, we added further detail to the Karen task example, reoriented our Jeffrey task example towards a new direction, and added a new requirement to the Marie task example. </p> <p>Revised Task Example 1: Jeffrey</p> <p>Jeffrey is a biomedical engineering and experimental medicine graduate student at UBC. They are non-binary and thus feel more comfortable in gender neutral washrooms. They know of 2 bathrooms on campus that are gender neutral: one in their department\u2019s building, and another in the Life building. On occasion, they will need to go to the washroom while exploring a new area of campus. During these times, Jeffrey typically opts for returning to one of their \u201csafe\u201d bathroom spots as they are unfamiliar with which surrounding buildings have gender neutral washrooms, which buildings have restricted access, and where specifically the bathrooms are located within each building. Depending on their current location on campus, they could be very far from the two gender neutral washrooms they know of. They would like to be able to easily and quickly find reliable information on what gender-neutral washrooms are nearby.  </p> <p>Our Jeffrey task example originally focused on a parent requiring changing tables to care for their child. During our field study however, we had difficulty acquiring data from parents with young children. While changing tables are an important amenity that can be incorporated as a filter option in our future prototypes, for now we will focus on the data we do have access to. We decided to reorient our task example to focus on an individual seeking gender-neutral washrooms as this was an important topic that we came across in our field studies. We adjusted the task example to replace known washrooms with changing tables to known gender-neutral washrooms, a situation we saw in one of our field study interviews. </p> <p>Revised Task Example 2: Karen</p> <p>Karen is a parent taking photos of her son by the UBC fountain before his graduation ceremony. This is her first time on campus, so she is unfamiliar with the facilities. The ceremony is starting soon, so she wants to find a washroom nearby that she can access quickly without much walking since she is wearing uncomfortable shoes. Since it is a later in the day, she is not sure which buildings are open to the public and which ones need keycard access, such as those that are locked after a certain time. It would take some time to check each building for access and facilities, and she is not sure which one will be easiest to access for her. She can ask her son for directions, and he is able to direct her towards a building, but she does not know where to go after entering the building. She looks around for signs but finds none. Instead, she looks around for a floor map and finds an evacuation map that she uses to locate the washroom.  </p> <p>For the Karen task example, our original example ended when Karen located a suitable building. Following our field study results, we found that locating washrooms after entering buildings was just as important as finding a suitable building. As such, we adjusted our Karen task example to add further detail on what happens after she enters a building, and the strategies she might employ to locate a washroom.  </p> <p>Revised Task Example 3: Marie</p> <p>Marie is a new teaching staff member at UBC and requires a wheelchair to move across campus. She has not had an orientation of the buildings she is teaching in and is not familiar with where facilities are located. She needs to find a washroom between her classes that is wheelchair accessible. She also wants to find a washroom that is close to her next class but worries about washroom availability with many students also using this time to use the restroom. While on her way to her next class, she happens to find a suitable wheelchair accessible washroom in a quiet area. She has another wheelchair user friend who often has similar difficulty in finding washrooms, so she wants to share information about this washroom with her friend so they can also access it in the future.</p> <p>The premise of our Marie task example is mostly unchanged. Marie is still a wheelchair user who requires an accessible washroom, but we have now added the new requirement of notifying her friend after she finds a suitable washroom. During our field study, we noticed a theme of external accessibility tools often containing outdated info. Users with specific needs often rely on word of mouth among the community in order to find suitable bathrooms. To combine these findings, we added the requirement of providing relevant information to others to allow users to generate up-to-date public information.   </p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/02/13/project-update-2/#2a-next-steps","title":"2a.

The tool would vibrate when the user is facing the correct direction, and the vibrations would get stronger as the user gets closer to the washroom. The tool can also use the small screen of a smartwatch to display the distance to the washroom and other relevant information.</p> Drawing design for the haptics wearable tool. <p>PROS:</p> <ul> <li>This tool can be used by users with visual impairments, as it does not rely on visual cues.</li> <li>This tool can be used without needing a screen, which is helpful for those holding items, using a cane, pushing a stroller, or walking in cold environments.</li> </ul> <p>CONS:</p> <ul> <li>This tool will have a steep learning curve, as it is not a common tool.</li> <li>The minimal visual information may be annoying for users that are used to seeing a map or other visual information.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Design 5: Tactile Direction Cube</p> <p>This design is a tactile cube/box -- inspired by pin art toys, that can be held by users to read immediate next step instructions.

Further Updated Task Examples","text":"<p>Original Task Examples (from blog update #2)</p> <p>Task Example 1: Jeffrey</p> <p>Jeffrey is a biomedical engineering and experimental medicine graduate student at UBC. They are non-binary and thus feel more comfortable in gender neutral washrooms. They know of 2 bathrooms on campus that are gender neutral: one in their department\u2019s building, and another in the Life building. On occasion, they will need to go to the washroom while exploring a new area of campus. During these times, Jeffrey typically opts for returning to one of their \u201csafe\u201d bathroom spots as they are unfamiliar with which surrounding buildings have gender neutral washrooms, which buildings have restricted access, and where specifically the bathrooms are located within each building. Depending on their current location on campus, they could be very far from the two gender neutral washrooms they know of. They would like to be able to easily and quickly find reliable information on what gender-neutral washrooms are nearby. </p> <p>Task Example 2: Karen</p> <p>Karen is a parent taking photos of her son by the UBC fountain before his graduation ceremony. This is her first time on campus, so she is unfamiliar with the facilities. The ceremony is starting soon, so she wants to find a washroom nearby that she can access quickly without much walking since she is wearing uncomfortable shoes. Since it is later in the day, she is not sure which buildings are open to the public and which ones need keycard access, such as those that are locked after a certain time. It would take some time to check each building for access and facilities, and she is not sure which one will be easiest to access for her. She can ask her son for directions, and he is able to direct her towards a building, but she does not know where to go after entering the building. She looks around for signs but finds none. Instead, she looks around for a floor map and finds an evacuation map that she uses to locate the washroom. </p> <p>Task Example 3: Marie</p> <p>Marie is a new teaching staff member at UBC and requires a wheelchair to move across campus. She has not had an orientation of the buildings she is teaching in and is not familiar with where facilities are located. She needs to find a washroom between her classes that is wheelchair accessible. She also wants to find a washroom that is close to her next class but worries about washroom availability with many students also using this time to use the restroom. While on her way to her next class, she happens to find a suitable wheelchair accessible washroom in a quiet area. She has another wheelchair user friend who often has similar difficulty in finding washrooms, so she wants to share information about this washroom with her friend so they can also access it in the future.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/02/29/project-update-3/#revised-task-examples","title":"Revised Task Examples","text":"<p>Two of our task examples remain unchanged, but the second task example called \"Karen\" has been updated slightly.</p> <p>Revised Task Example 2: Karen</p> <p>Karen is a parent taking photos of her son at the UBC fountain prior to his wedding ceremony.

Additional Information about Prototype","text":""},{"location":"blog/2024/02/29/project-update-3/#prototype-justification","title":"Prototype Justification","text":"<p>The chosen design of a mobile app supports all of our task examples. An app provides more flexibility and it can be used on the go, making it suitable for those who have limited time to find a washroom (e.g. Marie and Karen) as well as those who have time to explore. Furthermore, apps have built-in update mechanisms through the app stores. Thus, the app can be updated more quickly and easily to include new features or preferences that aren't currently accounted for. This would be more difficult and expensive with a stationary board or custom devices. Additionally, since UBC Vancouver provides both private and public Wi-Fi access, a mobile app can be easily downloaded by anyone on campus. For example, signs could be placed around campus with a QR code to direct the user to the app. </p> <p>As per our study findings, users all have different washroom needs and preferences. This design accounts for individual user preferences by allowing for detailed search and filtering. Also, it takes measures to categorize them for ease of use. Moreover, our study data found that maintaining an up-to-date source of information was a pain point for users who have more specific needs (such as gender neutral washrooms).

Rationale of Medium-Fidelity Prototyping Approach","text":"<p>How much horizontal and vertical?</p> <p>The scope of our prototype should be a 70/30 split between vertical and horizontal. We plan to focus more on providing vertical functionality to allow our prototype to fulfill our experimental tasks, though with enough horizontal functionality to provide an accurate overview of our app. As we plan on having 3 conditions and thus 3 versions of our prototype, areas unrelated to the main functions (such as the \u201cSettings\u201d page) will not be fully implemented to allow us to focus our efforts on the most relevant areas. </p> <p>What (simulated) functionality must it contain?</p> <p>The main functionality should include allowing participants to search for washrooms, navigate to the selected washroom, and add or update the information about specific washrooms. Since participants will not be physically walking to their selected washrooms, the navigation feature will be Wizard-of-Oz'd through displaying a sequence of screens with their location on the on-screen map changing. In addition, our ideal app will display specific information and instructions for each available washroom. As this would require a great deal of redundant effort, this will be constrained by giving participants the illusion of choice while having all washrooms lead to the same directions screen.  </p> <p>How important is appearance (i.e., the visual look)?</p> <p>As our app is based around maps and navigation, a clear and appealing visual appearance is needed to provide information to our participants. A colorful appearance would also itself well to the gamification conditions of our experiment. Lastly, an appealing visual look is important as it provides a more polished appearance to our prototype. </p> <p>If your interface includes physical (non-graphical) elements, is it useful and/or feasible to augment your functional prototype with form mockups?</p> <p>Our interface is entirely app-based, and thus does not include physical or non-graphical elements.  </p> <p>Finally, decide which prototyping tools to use. Most likely you will want to use one of the tools that you learned in CPSC 344</p> <p>The prototype will be created using Figma.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/03/12/project-update-5/#5b-prototype-demonstration","title":"5b.
